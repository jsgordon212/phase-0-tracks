# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**
It allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more file and merge revisions made by different people. This is useful for larger projects since it allows different people to work independently on specific aspects of a project and have their work reviewed by a different team member before merging it with the main project. It's a good method for allocating work to different people, while also being a good way to catch errors, make improvements, or just give general feedback.

* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**
A branch is a specific aspect or feature of a larger project that can be later added to the main project. You would use one to to add features to a program or file, without having to re-structure the entire project each time a feature is added or removed.

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
A commit is essentially a save point, allowing a project to return to that point if a different direction needs to be taken for the project or certain features aren't integrating well. A good commit message specifies clearly and succinctly what a particular branch or feature contains.

* **What is a merge conflict?**
A merge conflict occurs when two or more people make different changes to the same file, respectively, and attempt to merge. This is why it is important to write clear commit messages and have pull requests reviewed by a third party to avoid such conflicts.
